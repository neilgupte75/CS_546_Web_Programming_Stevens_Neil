                        <h2>About me</h2>
                        <p>I am a graduate student enrolled in the Stevens Institute of Technology for the term of Fall 2019. I am pursuing my Master in Computer Science.
                                Having completed my bachelors in computer engineering from India in the year 2018 I felt the urge to learn more and delve deeper into the nitty-gritty of areas of my interest which was the primary reason for opting to do masters.
                                I am mercurial and can gel in with people having different tastes. I am a huge soccer fanatic and die-hard supporter of English Club - Manchester United. I also loved to played various online multiplayer video games ,which I have toned down these days , but the fun fact is the inception of my actual interest in AI was while watching “The International “ which is the biggest E sports tournament in the world for the game of DOTA 2, wherein AI powered bot which was designed by a startup of Elon Musk named OpenAI defeated one of the best players in the world. The sure number of variables and choices the bot had to make in real-time made it an interesting feat.
